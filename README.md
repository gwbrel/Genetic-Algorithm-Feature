# Genetic-Algorithm-Feature
The implementation follows academic best practices and provides a robust foundation for feature selection using genetic algorithms.

Key Features of the Implementation:

  Complete GA Implementation:
  
  Binary chromosome representation

  Tournament selection
  
  Single-point crossover
  
  Bit-flip mutation
  
  Elitism preservation
  
  Proper Dataset Handling:
  
  Breast Cancer dataset loading
  
  StandardScaler for feature normalization
  
  60-20-20 split (train-validation-test)
  

# Comprehensive Evaluation:

  Comparison with all-features baseline
  
  Performance metrics (accuracy, execution time)
  
  Feature reduction analysis
  

# Visualization and Reporting:

  Fitness evolution plots
  
  Accuracy comparison charts

  
# Expected Results:
The genetic algorithm should typically:

  Reduce feature count by 40-60%
  
  Maintain comparable accuracy to using all features
  
  Demonstrate effective feature selection capability
